![GitHub issues](https://github.com/DeWiCats/dewicats-program-library/issues?style=flat-square)

Filter by ["good first issue"](https://github.com/DeWiCats/dewicats-program-library/issues?q=is%3Aopen+is%3Aissue+label%3A%22good+first+issue%22) to get your feet wet!
Once you submit a PR, our CI will generate a temporary testing URL where you can validate your changes. Tag any of the gatekeepers on the review to merge them into master.
